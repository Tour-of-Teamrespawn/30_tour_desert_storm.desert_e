STR_NOTE_2_TEXT,		"<br/>The base has suffered several attacks in that last 48h.<br/>Because of its strategic position the Takistan Army is making all they can to take it although, we belive the worse is yet to come.<br/>Their actions make us belive that they have been testing the Base defenses, and we are to expect a big attack in a near future.<br/><br/>Take note that the F.O.B. Storm is situated in the middle of the desert and far from any other military base, so radio comms between stations need to be made through the Satellite Radio in the main bunker.<br/><br/>Another problem you may find its the weather, in these last couple of weeks F.O.B. Storm has been suffering from heavy sand storms. Sometimes not much noticeble but, sometimes it can really blind. Just be careful, the enemy may take advantage from it.<br/><br/>Officer Damek will brief you before he leaves.<br/>"
